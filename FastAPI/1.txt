Part I. What’s New?
The world has benefited greatly from the invention of the World Wide Web by Sir Tim Berners-Lee,1 and the Python programming language by Guido van Rossum.

The only tiny problem is that a nameless computer book publisher often puts spiders and snakes on its relevant web and Python covers. If only the web had been named the World Wide Woof (cross-threads in weaving, also called weft), and Python were Pooch, this book might have had a cover like Figure I-1.

Figure I-1. FastAPI: Modern Pooch Woof Development
But I digress.2 This book is about the following:

The web
An especially productive technology, how it has changed, and how to develop software for it now

Python
An especially productive web development language

FastAPI
An especially productive Python web framework


#3


The two chapters in this first part discuss emerging topics in the web and in Python: services and APIs; concurrency; layered architectures; and big, big data.

Part II is a high-level tour of FastAPI, a fresh Python web framework that has good answers to the questions posed in Part I.

Part III rummages deeper through the FastAPI toolbox, including tips learned during production development.

Finally, Part IV provides a gallery of FastAPI web examples. They use a common data source—imaginary creatures—that may be a little more interesting and cohesive than the usual random expositions. These should give you a starting point for particular applications.
